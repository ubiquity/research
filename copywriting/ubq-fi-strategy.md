### Imagine this as the main page intro:

**u·biq·ui·ty** : the fact of appearing everywhere. 
At Ubiquity DAO we aim to keep true to our name. We strive to be everywhere in Crypto by providing genuine value and utility. That is our vision. 

There are many opportunities in the crypto space. A lot of tools, methods and processes are being developed. Many more have yet to have been thought of. As a builder DAO we see many of these opportunities and realize that an experienced responsible development path is necessary. Not just for us but for the industry we are part of.  
In order to be everywhere the first step is to build. We build tools that people need and marketplaces that people want.  

**The uAD Stablecoin:**
We began our Ubiquitous journey by entering the nascent world of blockchain and crypto backed gaming. We envisioned a Stablecoin that will be used on many games, projects and initiatives. We prodigiously began to build the model, Tokenomics and secure infrastructure and then we built it again uAD was born. uAD will be instrumental to all the future projects we will deploy. Including DevPool. 

**Enter DevPool:**
As our DAO grew we realized that the decentralized nature of DAOs, like Ubiquity, necessitated a new platform. 
A marketplace where we can call upon specialized talent, on demand, to help solve our problems. Not only was it a rethink of the hiring process, it was an organic extension to the way DAOs and the future of crypto will work. We soon realized it is also a sustainable model for how DAOs can optimally operate. This is where we embarked on building our first grand contribution to the crypto environment: The DevPool.


### The DevPool can be considered both a marketplace and a DAO OS. 

**As a marketplace:** DevPool enables DAOs to work smoother and develop faster. DevPool allows contributors to help build both horizontally and vertically based on their interest and get paid for their contributions. It is a marketplace where need meets supply.

**As an OS:** DevPool helps keep DAOs and project managers focused on their mission and deliverables. This is the OS component. Built on top of GitHub and integrating our extensible Ubiquibot AI, DevPool allows project managers to optimize their resources and collaborate with effective, results focused, talent to build and deploy their projects. 

Being built on top of GitHub means that DevPool enjoys all the features that are organic to GitHub and by extension it means that we can deploy the best of DAO models to also support existing web2 projects as well as future crypto development on GitHub. 

We are actively seeking out strategic partnerships with the leading names in the space alongside GitHub and Microsoft including Optimism, Gnosis and W3F to name a few. We already have existing relationships with Animoca, Merit Circle, Momentum6 and other prominent industry leaders. 

Once DevPool is deployed and we assure critical mass adoption we will continue to build additional tools and marketplaces to realize our goal of Ubiquity.
